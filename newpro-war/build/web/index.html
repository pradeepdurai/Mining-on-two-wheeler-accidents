        <h2><strong>Road accidents in India &#8211; Prevention</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 800;">Road traffic injuries can be mitigated. Addressing issues such as speeding and driving under the influence of alcohol, promoting the use of helmets, seatbelts and other restrains; ensuring that people walking, and cycling are more easily visible, improving the design of roads and vehicles, enforcing road safety regulations, and improving emergency response services has demonstrated that the needless deaths and disabilities caused by road traffic collisions can be prevented. In fact, road friendly policies and strict implementations of traffic rules and regulations could result in a decline in the incidence of road accidents. A substantial part of the reduction in fatalities is to be attributed to a set of measures aimed at improving the lot of pedestrians and cyclists through an improved road design and a better traffic management.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 800;">Road safety is a result of deliberate efforts on the part of many sectors of society â€“ government and non-government alike. An accident proof transport system is attainable with a well- designed and vigorous safety education programme. A safety culture is to be inculcated among motorists, cyclists and pedestrians. Needless to add, the traffic facilities have to be improved too. Only properly maintained or road worthy motor vehicles should be allowed to ply in the public places. There should be strict enforcements of traffic rules and motor laws. Lastly road safety campaign is an effective tool to carb accidents and it is the urgent need of the hour.</span></p>
